CodeceptJSnew
CodeceptJS is a modern end to end testing framework with a special BDD-style syntax. The tests are written as a linear scenario of the user's action on a site. This is a sample project for demonstrations of skill and capabilities. CodeceptJS bypasses execution commands to helpers. Depending on the helper enabled, your tests will be executed differently. If you need cross-browser support you should choose Selenium-based WebDriver or TestCaf√©. If you are interested in speed - you should use Chrome-based Puppeteer.
